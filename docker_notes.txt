Containers have revolutionized how software is packaged and shipped.

It works on my machine though. Why does this happen?
- Missing tools
- Different configuration
- Hardware dependencies

Previous Solutions:
- Configuration management tools (Chef, Puppet, Ansible)
    - Require knowledge about hardware and operating systems
- Virtual machines as code (Vagrant)
    - Heavy, slowish, require inconvenient configuration

Docker aims to take a simpler approach
    - Docker uses images and containers to allow apps to run anywhere, consistently
    - Images run on containers
    - Images are created from lightweight configuration files that describe everything your app needs to run

- Unlike virtual machines, containers are virtualized operating systems that are configured with just enough to run your app and nothing else.
